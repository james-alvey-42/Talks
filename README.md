# Talks

A repository of various talks given about physics, programming and other topics. These include:

* **New Physics in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis** - Based on [1910.01649](http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01649.pdf) where the implications of new thermal particles present during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis are discussed. *DMUK, University of Manchester, October 2019*. ([PDF](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/assets/pdf/DMUK.pdf))
* **Cosmological Constraints on MeV-scale Dark Sectors** - Summary talk based on [1910.01649](http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01649.pdf), [1905.05776](http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05776.pdf) and [1902.01450](http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01450.pdf) given during transfer to PhD viva. *King's College London, October 2019*.
* **The Atmosphere as a Beam Dump** - Talk based on [1905.05776](http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05776.pdf) regarding the production of light dark matter from interactions of high energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere and the relation to direct detection results. *BUSSTEPP, University of Glasgow, August 2019*. ([PDF](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/assets/pdf/beam-dump.pdf))
* **Dark Matter and Neutrinos** - Based on [1902.01450](http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01450.pdf) before results were finalised. Discusses the possible links between dark matter, neutrino masses, and how to constrain these models with IceCube. *DM Horizons, King's College London, December 2018*.
* **Fundamental Interactions Winter School** - A summary of the winter school at the GGI Institute in Florence. *DM Horizons, King's College London, February 2019*.
* **Effective Field Theory** - A non-technical introduction to effective field theory. *Mathematics Society, Tonbridge School, December 2018*.
* **Primordial Non-Gaussianity** - An introduction to Primordial Non-Gaussianity in the Cosmic Microwave Background. *Part III Seminar Series, University of Cambridge (DAMTP), December 2017*.
